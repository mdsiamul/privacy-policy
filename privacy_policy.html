        <h1>Privacy Policy for SnapCard</h1>
        <p class="update-date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 27, 2025</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p>SnapCard ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our business card scanner application.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>🔒 Privacy-First Approach</h3>
            <p><strong>SnapCard is designed to be completely offline-first and privacy-focused.</strong> All your business card data, scanned images, and contact information are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or share your personal data with any third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device:</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Business Card Images:</strong> Photos you capture or select from your gallery</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and other details extracted from scanned cards or entered manually</li>
                <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences for app functionality (e.g., theme, notification settings)</li>
                <li><strong>Tags and Notes:</strong> Any custom tags, categories, or notes you add to cards</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> All this data remains on your device and is never automatically transmitted to any server or third party.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Information stored on your device is used solely for:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Displaying your scanned business cards</li>
                <li>Enabling search and organization features</li>
                <li>Providing contact management functionality</li>
                <li>Offering data export options (e.g., vCard export, contacts integration)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Permissions and Why We Need Them</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>SnapCard requests the following permissions to provide its core functionality. All permissions are used only for the stated purposes and data remains on your device:</p>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>📷 Camera Permission (android.permission.CAMERA)</h3>
                <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To scan business cards using your device's camera.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> When you use the camera to scan a card, the image is processed locally using on-device OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text. The captured image is stored only in your device's local storage.</p>
                <p><strong>What we don't do:</strong> We never upload card images to any server, cloud service, or third party. No images leave your device without your explicit action (e.g., if you choose to share a card manually).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>📇 Contacts Permission (android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS)</h3>
                <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To allow you to save scanned business cards directly to your phone's contacts app.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> When you tap "Save to Contacts" on a card, we use write-only access to create a new contact entry with the card's information in your device's contacts database.</p>
                <p><strong>What we don't do:</strong> We never read or access your existing contacts. This is a one-way operation - we only write data when you explicitly choose to save a card to contacts. We do not sync, read, or analyze your contacts list.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>💾 Storage Permission (android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</h3>
                <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To save card images locally on your device and to allow you to import images from your gallery or export cards as vCard files.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> Store scanned card images in your device's app-specific storage directory. Allow you to select images from your gallery for scanning. Export cards as .vcf (vCard) files when you choose to share them.</p>
                <p><strong>What we don't do:</strong> We only access the files you explicitly select or create through the app. We do not scan, access, or transmit any other files or media from your device.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored locally using secure SQLite database with encryption options</li>
                <li><strong>No Cloud Uploads:</strong> No automatic data synchronization or cloud uploads occur</li>
                <li><strong>App Lock:</strong> Optional PIN and biometric authentication to protect your cards from unauthorized access</li>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Your data security depends on your device's security measures (screen lock, encryption, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>We do not share your data with anyone.</strong> SnapCard does not transmit any data to our servers or third parties. The only ways your data leaves your device are:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>When you explicitly choose to export a card (e.g., share as vCard via email or messaging)</li>
                <li>When you save a card to your device's contacts (local operation only)</li>
                <li>When you manually share a card using Android's share functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these actions are initiated by you and are under your complete control.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>SnapCard uses the following third-party components that operate entirely on your device:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Google ML Kit Text Recognition:</strong> Runs locally on your device to extract text from images. No data is sent to Google servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Flutter Framework:</strong> The UI framework used to build the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not integrate any analytics SDKs, advertising networks, or tracking services.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>SnapCard is a general-purpose business card scanner and is not specifically designed for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will assist you in deleting the data from the device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Your data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual cards at any time within the app</li>
                <li><strong>Uninstalling:</strong> Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data from your device</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the app after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Because all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Access: View all your cards and data within the app at any time</li>
